## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- View the optimal layout for the app depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- Select and submit a number rating
- See the "Thank you" card state after submitting a rating

### Installation

- Install node.js and [vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/), on this link you have a guide but I'll walk you through it anyways:
- npm create vite@latest
- React
- Javascript
- projectName
- follow the instructions and voila you are all set

* if you close it, you can just rerun it again by simply opening this project and in type "npm run dev" in your IDE terminal (I use VS Code). Maybe this is common knowledge but it took me ages to figure this out lol. üòÅ And type "o" (letter) in terminal to open your App.

- To deploy React App on github pages:
- not easy, having a lot of trouble
- [this](https://dev.to/shashannkbawa/deploying-vite-app-to-github-pages-3ane)

## My process

### Built with

- HTML, CSS flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/)
- [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/guide/)

### What I learned

React states, passing information through props, and all of that through React forms. Trying to have a single source of thruth. I think it lacks the useEffect ??? My understanding is still very basic.

### Continued development

This challenge was way harder than I expected. I guess I didn't understand React states the way I thought I did. The code is not perfect or the cleanest, but it works. It took me 3 days to do this and I got so angry and frustrated. I'll definetely go back to this and rewrite it better and more efficient. There is a lot of repetition.
I need to organize the CSS file way better.
And Javascript and myself need to get to know each other way better and eventually become friends.
This doesn't sound very professional, but I'm just being honest. üòÅ
For every aspiring future developer:
IF I CAN DO THIS - SO CAN YOU - AND YOU CAN DO IT WAY BETTER!

### Useful resources

- [Scrimba - Learn React](https://scrimba.com/learn/learnreact) - This free course helped me so much. The instructor is really great and examples are reusable.
